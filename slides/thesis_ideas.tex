  \frametitle{Privacy}

  Problem: Preserving consumer privacy, while at the same time getting enough information to balance the power grid.

  Possible solutions:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Finding balance in how much different actors should be able to see
    \item Creating noise in home consumption with additional usage
    \item Using a home battery to alter between external and internal consumption
    \item Smarter protocols -- e.g.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Zero Knowledge Proofs
      \item Secure Multiparty Computation
      \item Verifiable Computation
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
